  VULNERABLE:
  Slowloris DOS attack
    State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
    IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
      Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
      them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
      the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
      the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.
